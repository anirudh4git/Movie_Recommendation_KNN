# Movie_Recommendation_KNN
A recommender system which would recommend the 5 most similar movies to a movie query based on cosine similarity as well as eucledian distance.

I wanted to find out which movies are similar to a given movie. Used kNN algorithm to identify the most similar movies.

I chose to restrict myself to the columns, Movie ID, Movie Name, IMDB Rating and binary indicators of different genres.
